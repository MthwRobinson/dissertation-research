# Requirements Engineering Effectiveness in Open Source Software

Iyer, Deepa Gopal, and Kalle Lyytinen. “Requirements Engineering Effectiveness in Open Source Software." Requirements Engineering 5 (2019): 15-2019. 

## Summary

- Community participation is a major differentiator for how OSS projects are managed. Also less formal and dependent on documentation.
- The way the projects are managed is less strategic (no long term view)
- Communication structure of OSS projects varies significatly (from highly distributed to highly centralized)
- Hypothesis: OSS projects spread into "sub-projects" as the scope of the project increases- Goal: see whether the "centrality" of the communication structure impacts task completion rate
     - Note, "centrality" here seems not to mean network centrality, but indicates whether the project has a single "hub" or operates as a number of sub-projects.
- Degree centrality decreases as the number of actors increases
- Finding: more centralized projects have higher rates of task completion

## Thoughts

- They have a different target variable than us. They are looking at task completion rate, whereas we are looking at the prioritization of individual tasks.
