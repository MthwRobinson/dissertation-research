## The Crowd in Requirements Engineering

Wood, John, Shahram Sarkani, Thomas Mazzuchi, and Timothy Eveleigh. "A framework for capturing the hidden stakeholder system." Systems engineering 16, no. 3 (2013): 251-266

### Summary

- Stakeholder crosswalk is used to determine which stakeholders are relevant for a given decision.
    - Separate "matrix" for each phase in a program
    - Traits of SHs in a network: power, legitimacy, and urgency.
- Stakeholder maps shows how influence is propogated across the SH network.
    - Roles in the network map:
        1. Central connector
        2. Broker
        3. Boundary spanner
        4. Peripheral Specialist
        5. Pulse taker
- Insight: centrality of a node does not necessarily indicate the strenght/quality of a SH, it just helps identify their role within the system.
