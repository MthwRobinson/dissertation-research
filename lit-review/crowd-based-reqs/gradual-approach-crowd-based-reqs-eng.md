## A Gradual Approach to Crowd-Based Requirements Engineering: The Case of Conference Online Social Networks

Levy, Meira, Irit Hadar, and Dov Te'eni. "A gradual approach to crowd-based requirements engineering: The case of conference online social networks." In 2015 IEEE 1st International Workshop on Crowd-Based Requirements Engineering (CrowdRE), pp. 25-30. IEEE, 2015.

### Summary

- Goal of the paper is to mitigate the potential for low crowd participation
- Advocate for using micro crowds
- Use case: online social networks for academic researchers.
- CBRE good for distributed + varied stakeholder groups
- Used collaborative filtering + social networks for crowd source reqs
- The "gradual approach" involves iteratively engaging with the crowd throughout the system lifecycle, as opposed to just gathering requirements at the beginning.
- Create small micro-crowds at the beginning and merge them as the process progresses.

### Thoughts

- The iterative approach was interesting, but I don't think this paper will be particularly informative for our research.
