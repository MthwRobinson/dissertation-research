## Social Networks and Crowdsourcing for Stakeholder Analysis in System of Systems Projects

Lim, Soo Ling, and Cornelius Ncube. "Social networks and crowdsourcing for stakeholder analysis in system of systems projects." In 2013 8th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering, pp. 13-18. IEEE, 2013.

### Summary

- Deals specifically with systems of systems
- Use social network analysis to focus on highly influential stakeholders
- Issue addressed by CBRE: tendency to excluded stakedholders without a high level of knowledge or interest
- Potential issues with traditional RE:
    1. Potential to miss important stakeholders.
    2. Tendency to treat all stakeholders as equally important
- Existing SH identification approaches:
    1. Semi-Structured -- ID stakeholders by brainstorming use cases and finding stakeholders who fit those use cases
    2. Checklist-based -- a list of stakeholder roles for the system
    3. Interview method
    4. Search method -- ask each SH you identify to identify a follow on stakeholder. Problem: potential to generate too many stakeholders, and even non-SHs.
- Builds a network with stakeholders as nodes and compute centrality measures **Note, should cite this because this is very similar to our approach.**
- Software they use is called StakeSource.
- Network centrality was able to uncover SHs who turned out to be very important. Especially useful when there are a large number of stakeholders.
- Useful for mapping sub-system boundaries in a system of systems context
- Some SHs move on / lose interest and must be removed from the network.

### Thoughts

- This is interesting because it seems like their intentionally doing something (focusing on influential stakeholders) that we've flagged as something problematic.
- Good precedent for our use of centrality measures. Can frame our research as empirically testing whether project manager _do_ focus on influential staekholders.
