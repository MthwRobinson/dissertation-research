## Towards Crowdsourcing for Requirements Engineering

### Summary

- Crowdsourcing important because audiences are becoming broader.
- Problem includes eliciting new requirments and judging the current quality of the product.
- Users may also identify requriements that are no longer relevant.
- Benefits: gaining a wider range of more relevant, up-to-date feedback.
- Other attempts to use the crowd:
    1. Requirments Driven Social Adaptation: based on determining stakeholder perceptions of the system's role in achieving their requirements. Also mentioned in "The Crowd in Stakdholder Reqs."
    2. Feedback Based Requirements Engineering: iterative approach based on user feedback.
    3. Stakeholder's Discovery: hard to determine stakeholders ahead of time. Consider stakeholders a social network. Find a few stakeholders, who then recommend more. **Could be good to mention in lit review because it is social network related.**
    4. Empirical Validation: used to collect user feedback on the requirements process, which is then used to iterate on the requirements.
- Research outcomes on crowdsourcing. Results are based on two focus groups.
    1. Large crowds lead to more diverse requirements and less concensus.
    2. Anonymous participation leads to more honesty, more willingness to participants, more creativity, and higher quality requirements.
    3. Collaboration requires more overhead to manage but results in more correct requirements.
    4. Volunteer / Open Calls leaders to more motivated / actively engaged participants, but may provide misleading results because volunteers are not represenative. **This supports our thesis that crowd source reqs are biased in favor of active participants.**
    5. Opt out Opportunity: move motivation to be actively involved, more willingness to participant in the future, creates feeling amongst stakeholders that their ideas are important. 

### Thoughts
- "Stakeholder's Discovery" could suffer from bias in favor of highly involved stakeholders, per our thesis.
- Software development seems to be a common example for crowd sourcing reqs, which fits in well with our research.
