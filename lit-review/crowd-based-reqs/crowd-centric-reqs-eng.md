## Crowd Centric Requirements Engineering

Snijders, Remco, Fabiano Dalpiaz, Mahmood Hosseini, Alimohammad Shahri, and Raian Ali. "Crowd-centric requirements engineering." In 2014 IEEE/ACM 7th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, pp. 614-615. IEEE, 2014.

### Summary

- Observation: users seldom involved in the requirement generation process.
- Issues with current solutions:
    1. Narrow concept of a user; preference given to stakeholders who pay for the system, even though the end user might be someone else.
    2. Stakeholder interviews may not be translated into requirements for the project.
    3. No incentive for users to engage.
- Authors suggest that providing incentives to users through gamifications could spur more user participation in the requirements process.
- If users participate, they are rewarded iwith social recognition and satisfaction (since they are driving decision making).
- Authors note that crowd sourcing methods may only make sense for a subset of the requirements. Specifically mention requirements that wouldn't need special expertise to break down.
- Challenges:
    1. Need for software companies to be open
    2. User generated requirements may create dissatisfactions in the project doesn't deliver on those requirements.

### Thoughts

- Compared to software that is designed for non-technical end users, open source software projects may have less of an issue with stakeholders not being incentived to participate. Usually users who raise issues need them to be resolved in order to accomplish tasks of their own.
- Need for companies to be open is not an issue in an open source context.
- Potential dissatisfaction of users due to unmet requirments could be something that is addressed through our research.
