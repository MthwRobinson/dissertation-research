Title: Evaluating the Structure of Crowd-Based Stakeholder Networks

Authors: Matthew Robinson, Shahram Sarkani, and Thomas Mazzuchi

Abstract: Proponents argue that crowd-based requirements processes enable project managers to generate better requirements by eliciting feedback from a broader range of stakeholders. However, relying on crowds increases the risk that project managers will overlook the needs of less active stakeholders. The magnitude of this risk depends on the structure of the stakeholder network for a given project. A stakeholder network is a graph where stakeholders are nodes. An edge exists between any two stakeholders who have collaborated on a requirement. This paper tests the hypothesis that the degree distribution of a stakeholder network becomes more concentrated as the number of stakeholders in the network increases. To test this hypothesis, we construct stakeholder networks for over 1,000 open source software projects using publicly available project management data.  We consider a network concentrated if its degree distribution conforms to a power law and use the Gini coefficient to measure the level of concentration. Regression analysis suggests that, on average, networks with more stakeholders have higher levels of concentration. These results will form the basis of follow-on research, which will empirically evaluate the impact of network structure on the prioritization of crowd-sourced system requirements.
